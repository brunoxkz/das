Reference your icons in the web app manifest
Use the icons web app manifest member to define a set of icons for your PWA.

As described in Create the necessary icon sizes, you should create multiple versions of your icon to ensure it appears correctly in all the places where it's used. This is why the icons member is an array of objects, each of which represents an icon, with its own size, type, and purpose. Each icon object has the following properties:

src
The URL of the icon image file.

sizes
The sizes the icon can be used for.

type
The MIME type of the image file which the operating system can use to quickly ignore images it does not support.

purpose
The OS-specific purpose of the image.

For example, the following web app manifest defines five PNG icons, each with a different size:

json
Copy to Clipboard
{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-72.png",
      "sizes": "72x72",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-128.png",
      "sizes": "128x128",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-144.png",
      "sizes": "144x144",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
Create the necessary icon sizes
Various operating systems use different icon sizes in different places and for different device capabilities. It's important to create multiple versions of your icon so it appears correctly in all the places where it's used.

For example, Windows can display your app icon as a 44x44 pixels image in the taskbar, or as a 150x150 pixels image in the start menu. Use the links below for more information about the icon sizes used by different operating systems and tips for creating effective icons:

For Windows, see Define icons and a theme color on learn.microsoft.com.
For Android, see Google Play icon design specifications on developer.android.com.
For iOS and macOS, see App icons on developer.apple.com.
The sizes at which your icon is displayed depend on the operating system and may change over time. It's best to test your icon on all the devices and operating systems you want to support, and generate the sizes and image types that lead to the best results. You can also use a tool like PWA Image Generator to generate the necessary icon sizes for you from a single high-definition image.

Note that some operating systems support SVG icons which can help reduce the number of images you need to create since SVG can be scaled to any size automatically. If your SVG icon doesn't scale down to small sizes nicely, creating additional icons with fewer details and less complexity may be necessary. To support all OSs and small sizes, create PNG versions of your icon as well.

The following web app manifest example uses a WebP image for the small icon, an ICO image for medium size icons, and a scalable SVG image for higher resolution icons:

json
Copy to Clipboard
{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-small.webp",
      "sizes": "48x48",
      "type": "image/webp"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-medium.ico",
      "sizes": "72x72 96x96 128x128 256x256"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-high.svg",
      "sizes": "257x257"
    }
  ]
}
